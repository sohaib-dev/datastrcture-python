Python list is a dynamic array.

Arrray Insertion Complexity : O(n)

Linklist Complexity:

Insert Element at Beginning : O(1)

Delete Element at Beginning : O(1)

Insert/Delete Element at End : O(n)

Traversal : O(n)

Access Element by Value : O(n)



LinkedList has two main advantage over array:

1- You don't need to pre-allocate the space.

2- Insertion/Deletion is easier


LinkedList has following drawbacks:

1- Random access is not allowed and you need to traverse sequentially to access the element.

2- Extra memory space is required to store the nex_node pointer.

3- Arrays have better cache locality and have high performance.
